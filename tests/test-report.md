### üí≠ Reflection

**Challenges:** Understanding filter logic and testing across browsers.  
**Effective Techniques:** Black-box testing for validation and white-box for filtering logic.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- Some intentional bugs helped understand real QA workflows.
- Accessibility testing is easy to overlook but very important.
- White-box testing could verify logic for filters and form validation.
- Realized how minor issues like missing alt-text can affect accessibility and user trust.
